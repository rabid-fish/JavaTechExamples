ExampleTiles2 and ExampleTiles3 are sister projects meant to show off
the maven configuration necessary to get Apache Tiles, Spring Mvc,
slf4j, and Jackson to play nice together.

The big benefits of this project are:
1) the pom.xml actually works
2) web.xml shows how your static and non static resources should be mapped
3) the actual templating language remains jsp
4) easy support for ajax
